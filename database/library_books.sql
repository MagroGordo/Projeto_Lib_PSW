There, he takes care of the giant clocks in place of his uncle, who has disappeared. At night, he tries to repair a human-like machine to uncover a hidden message, using parts from toys he steals. His plans, however, are at risk. He is discovered by the owner of the station\'s toy shop and the curious Isabelle. This masterpiece blends elements of cinema and comics to tell a story about the early days of cinema, the desire to create life, and the adventure of imagination.','images/1.jpg','2025-10-27 14:34:06','2025-11-08 03:35:30',1),(2,'Dune','Frank Herbert','9788691654771',209,1965,'Nova Fronteira e Editora Aleph','The desert planet Arrakis — known as Dune — has been destroyed.

Klaus, Sunny, and Violet are charming and intelligent, but they rank first among the unhappiest people in the world. In fact, misfortune follows them from the very first page, when they are at the beach and receive tragic news. These magnets for misfortune will have to face, for example, a slimy villain driven by greed, a calamitous fire, clothes that itch, and cold porridge for breakfast. That is why, on the fourth cover, Snicket warns the reader: ‘There is nothing to stop you from closing the book immediately and going out to read something else about happy things, if that is what you prefer.’','images/3.jpg','2025-10-27 14:35:32','2025-11-08 03:35:30',1),(4,'Los Hombres que no Amaban a las Mujeres','Stieg Larsson','9789688997680',720,2015,'Companhia das Letras','It\'s just a preview of the tension that unfolds in the book.

And changing habits is difficult, even for very intelligent people. Money – whether in investment, personal finance or business decisions – is usually explained based on mathematics, where formulas and data tell us exactly what to do. But in real life, people don\'t make financial decisions based on an Excel spreadsheet. They do it at the dinner table, in a meeting room, and in so many other situations where personal history – our unique view of the world – ego, pride, marketing and strange incentives all come into play.','images/5.jpg','2025-10-27 14:37:21','2025-11-08 03:35:30',2),(6,'Secrets of the Millionaire Mind','T.

It challenges the belief that your home is an asset – as millions of people learned when the housing bubble burst. Reminds us why we cannot rely on the school system to teach our children about money – and why this fundamental life skill is more important today than ever before.

Napoleon Hill, a young journalist, interviewed steel magnate Andrew Carnegie—probably the richest American of the early 20th century. During their conversation, Carnegie challenged the reporter to interview 500 millionaires to find out what they had in common. For 20 years, Napoleon Hill devoted himself to the mission and, with Carnegie\'s support and advice, compiled a series of principles he called ‘The Laws of Success.’ Think and Grow Rich summarises these laws in a work that has inspired millions of readers. The ideas contained in this book, in addition to providing effective recipes for making money, teach how to obtain the spiritual satisfaction that comes from achieving one\'s goals.','images/8.jpg','2025-10-27 14:37:21','2025-11-08 03:35:30',2),(9,'The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair','Joël Dicker','9782233120687',320,2013,'Alfaguara','Convinced of Harry\'s innocence, Marcus abandons everything and leaves for Aurora to conduct his own investigation. His goal is to save his career by writing a book about the hottest case of the year and to answer the question that has America on edge: Who killed Nola Kellergan? ‘Everyone was talking about the book.’ This is the first sentence of the novel The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair: a prophecy that came true, as Joël Dicker\'s book has become a worldwide phenomenon.','images/9.jpg','2025-10-27 14:42:45','2025-11-08 03:35:30',3),(10,'The Hound of the Baskervilles','Arthur Conan Doyle','9780890529379',256,2011,'Bertrand Editora','For five centuries, Baskerville Hall has been home to the Baskerville family. When the lord of the manor, Hugo Baskerville, is found dead, with signs of having been savagely attacked by an animal, a legend arises that the property is inhabited by a black, diabolical hound that breathes fire from its eyes and mouth. Everyone fears the terrible animal, and anyone who dares to approach the moor near the manor where the beast reigns dies. This is what happens to Sir Charles Baskerville, who is found dead. His death is immediately attributed to the hound that spreads terror throughout the neighbourhood. The new lord of the manor, Henry Baskerville, Sir Charles\' nephew, decides to call on Sherlock Holmes to solve the mystery surrounding his uncle\'s death. With his usual wit, Holmes sets off for the manor, together with his inseparable Doctor Watson, to try to discover the mysterious animal and prevent it from killing anyone else, as danger lurks everywhere.','images/10.jpg','2025-10-27 14:42:45','2025-11-08 03:35:30',3),(11,'Misery','Stephen King','9783048763038',400,2013,'Bertrand Editora','Paul Sheldon is a famous writer of romance novels, made famous by the main character in his works, Misery Chastain. However, Sheldon realised it was time to turn the page and decided to “kill off” Misery. It is then that he suffers a terrible car accident and is rescued by Annie Wilkes, a former nurse who takes him to her home to treat him. What Paul does not know is that Annie, his saviour, is also his biggest fan, the most fanatical and obsessed of all — and she is furious about Misery\'s death. Injured and unable to walk, totally at Annie\'s mercy, Paul is forced to write a new book to “resurrect” Misery, like a modern-day Scheherazade in the hands of a deranged psychopath who has long since lost touch with reality. Filled with complex psychological games between hostage and captor, Misery is a work of suspense and terror in its purest form.','images/11.jpg','2025-10-27 14:42:45','2025-11-08 03:35:30',3),(12,'Dirty Game','Jessie Keane','9789962973591',561,2015,'Marcador','John Connolly and James “Whitey” Bulger grew up together on the streets of South Boston. Decades later, in the mid-1970s, they met again. By then, Connolly was a prominent figure in the Boston FBI office and Whitey had become a godfather of the Irish Mafia. What happened next—a dirty deal to take down the Italian Mafia in exchange for protection for Bulger—quickly spiralled out of the FBI\'s control, leading to murders, drug trafficking, racketeering and extortion, and ultimately the biggest informant scandal in FBI history. Thanks to the powerful and compelling writing of the two reporters, who followed the case from the beginning, Dirty Game is simultaneously a fascinating crime story, a warning about the abuse of power, and a penetrating look at Boston.','images/12.jpg','2025-10-27 14:42:45','2025-11-08 03:35:30',3),(13,'O Hospital de Alfaces','Pedro Chagas Freitas','9785932559604',645,2024,'Oficina de Livro','The story of three generations: grandfather, father and son intertwine in touching moments that make us reflect on the ephemeral nature of life and how love saves us at all times.

It\'s not brilliant. Nor is it sensible. In fact, it might deserve a place on the podium of the worst ideas ever: who, in their right mind, decides to find a bride for the love of their life? In her defence, she swears it\'s for a good cause. James needs to marry to inherit the family empire. Olivia needs him to vote in favour of the project that could save the home where she works. Sounds simple, right? Well, it\'s not. Especially when they\'ve barely spoken to each other in four years. Or rather, when he refuses to speak to her! Chaos is guaranteed. But Olivia is already a veteran in this territory: for twenty-two years she has been stumbling through life, in a disastrous mix of good intentions and bad decisions. How else would she have ended up teaching Pilates to old ladies with more nerve than filter?','images/15.jpg','2025-10-27 14:44:48','2025-11-08 03:35:30',4),(16,'Verity','Colleen Hoover','9789321819775',421,2019,'TopSeller','Lowen Ashleigh is a writer struggling with serious financial difficulties until she accepts an offer she can\'t refuse: to finish the last three volumes of the successful series by Verity Crawford, a renowned author who was left incapacitated after a terrible accident. In order to get inside Verity\'s head and study the notes and ideas gathered over years of work, Lowen accepts the invitation of Jeremy Crawford, the author\'s husband, and temporarily moves into their home. But what she didn\'t expect to find in Verity\'s chaotic office was the author\'s unfinished autobiography. As she reads it, she realises that it was never meant to be shared with anyone. It is pages and pages of chilling confessions, including Verity\'s memories of the day her daughter died.','images/16.jpg','2025-10-27 14:44:48','2025-11-08 03:35:30',4),(17,'Auto da Barca do Inferno','Gil Vincente','9785509572708',64,1517,'Porto Editora','An allegorical play that portrays the judgment of souls after death, where an Angel and a Devil wait on opposite docks, each with their own boat, to carry the souls away. Through the dialogue between the souls and the boatmen, the play criticizes the vices and corruption of 16th-century society, as most souls are condemned to hell for their sins—such as greed, hypocrisy, and corruption—while only the most sincere souls and the knights who died defending the faith are saved.','images/17.jpg','2025-11-05 00:40:08','2025-11-11 01:30:28',5),(18,'Memorial do Convento','José Saramago','9784374797575',402,1982,'Porto Editora','A historical and allegorical novel that intertwines the construction of the Mafra Convent with the dreams and struggles of common people in 18th-century Portugal. Through the stories of Baltasar, a maimed ex-soldier, and Blimunda, a woman with the power to see inside people, the book contrasts the grandeur and ambition of the king and the Church with the poverty and suffering of the people. At the same time, the invention of the flying machine, built by Father Bartolomeu de Gusmão with the help of Baltasar and Blimunda, symbolizes the human desire for freedom and transcendence. With his distinctive narrative voice and long, flowing sentences, Saramago critiques power, religion, and social injustice, while celebrating love, imagination, and hope.','images/18.jpg','2025-11-05 00:52:01','2025-11-08 03:35:30',5),(19,'Os Lusíadas','Luís de Camões','9781564781178',648,1572,'Porto Editora','An epic poem that celebrates the great deeds of the Portuguese during the Age of Discovery, centered on Vasco da Gama’s voyage to India. Blending history, mythology, and allegory, the work exalts the courage, faith, and ambition of the Portuguese nation while exploring the human cost of glory and conquest. The gods of classical mythology intervene throughout the narrative, reflecting the conflicts between destiny, divine will, and human freedom. Through rich and symbolic language, Camões not only glorifies Portugal’s maritime achievements but also questions the moral and spiritual values behind imperial expansion, making Os Lusíadas both a national epic and a reflection on the nature of heroism, power, and fate.','images/19.jpg','2025-11-05 00:55:34','2025-11-08 03:35:30',5),(20,'Os Maias','Eça de Queirós','9785533644303',736,1888,'Porto Editora','A realist novel that portrays the decline of a Portuguese aristocratic family, using the story of Carlos da Maia and his doomed love affair with Maria Eduarda as a reflection of the moral, social, and cultural decay of 19th-century Lisbon. Through detailed descriptions and sharp irony, Eça de Queirós exposes the hypocrisy, vanity, and stagnation of the Portuguese bourgeoisie and nobility. The novel contrasts the idealism and disillusionment of its characters with a broader national critique, revealing a society trapped between tradition and modernity. Both a family saga and a social satire, The Maias stands as one of the greatest achievements of Portuguese literature, blending realism, romantic tragedy, and biting humor to depict a country in search of identity and progress.','images/20.jpg','2025-11-05 00:58:13','2025-11-08 03:35:30',5);
